# StitchAR
An Android app to stitch together 2D photos of items to generate shareable 3D objects for users that can be placed anywhere using an integrated login system and AR engine.

E-commerce is a growing trend that is here to stay. Many traditionally retail stores such as IKEA have now adapted to the digital era and offer sales online. But the problem with this is that very often, consumers are disastified with the product they have purchased because it is not exactly as described or does not exactly reflect the image they saw online. 

Buying a sofa and want to know what it would look like in your living room? No problem! With StitchAR, users can both generate and view 2D that have been "stitched" together to make an object with a unique code that can be viewed in AR. The overarching goal of this app is to make online shopping smoother and more satisfying for both the consumers and the producers. 

Tools Used:
- Android Studio for front-end app development
- Backend server developed using Node to handle requests and implement API's
- Autodesk Reality Capture API to stitch together 2D photos into a 3D AR object
- Firebase Auth for consumers/sellers to log into their respective accounts
- Google AR Core to place objects down within a camera engine in the app so users can view these objects in their environment.
